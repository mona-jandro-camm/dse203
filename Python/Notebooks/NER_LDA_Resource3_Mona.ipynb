      "['CLOSE Stanford: Zach Hoffpauir, 6-0, 195, sophomore, outfielder, Peoria Centennial (Photo: Stanford) Doug Hoffpauir said that his son Zach`s brain has been donated to Boston University for CTE research. Zach Hoffpauir, a former Peoria Centennial and Stanford football safety, died last Thursday at the age of 26. Doug said the university reached out the day after news broke about his son`s death to see if the family would be willing to donate Zach`s brain for its Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy Center that studies long-term consequences of repetitive head trauma. Zach, a 2012 Centennial graduate who was an All-Arizona safety and a top safety and baseball player at Stanford, suffered concussions during his football career, Doug said. \"I`m not anti-football, I`m not anti-anything,\" Doug said. \"I think it`s good to research if it helps people. We talked about it as a family. It was not for an agenda, saying blaming football or blaming CTE. It may have.\" He said he was told results won`t come back for a year. Doug Hoffpauir hasn`t provided details of his son`s death, but said, \"Zach didn`t die from suicide.\" \"Maybe a year ago he was in that state,\" Doug added. \"He was excited.\" Zach Hoffpauir, shown in action against UCLA, had two tackles against Arizona State in the Pac-12 Championship Game as a sophomore in 2013. (Photo: Jayne Kamin-Oncea-USA TODAY Sports) Zach recently had been hired by University of Northern Colorado football coach Ed McCaffrey to be his defensive backs coach next season. The coronavirus pandemic shut schools down, keeping everybody at home. Hoffpauir was close friends with Ed`s son, Christian McCaffrey, the Stanford All-American running back who is now a star for the Carolina Panthers. Zach, who spent some time playing in the Arizona Diamondbacks` organization, was living with his father in Glendale when he died. Doug said his son was ecstatic about coaching college football and would hear the heart-felt excitement in his son`s voice when he was talking to a recruit or one of the Northern Colorado players on the phone. Doug said his son was looking forward to buying a truck because he needed a four-wheel drive on his recruiting trips. He was in charge of recruiting Arizona for Northern Colorado. Doug said his son had not only dealt with concussions, but Lyme disease, Valley fever and meningitis. \"He had a lot of anxiety and depression,\" Doug said. \"It all made sense. His senior year (at Stanford), when he didn`t play in the Senior Bowl game, (Stanford coach David) Shaw had a sit down with him. He saw what he was going through and said, `It`s not worth it. Don`t get another concussion.` \"What I loved about Stanford is that they had the player`s best interest before the game. He had a lot of concussions. He`d say, `Dad, I don`t feel so good.` \" Zach Hoffpauir, a two-sport star in high school and at Stanford, was drafted by the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2015 and played for the organization`s Class A short season team that summer in Hillsboro, Oregon. (Photo: Wade Payne, AP) On his son`s death, Doug said, \"For me and for Zach, I want to say he fell asleep and didn`t wake up. The poor kid never slept. He had insomnia. It was rough. It was hard on him. He fought through it. He journaled a lot of stuff. It was neat to see in his journal how excited he was about his new aspect in life, how hard he was working.\" A celebration of Zach Hoffpauir`s life will take place May 30 at 10 a.m. at Christ`s Church of the Valley`s Peoria campus. Doug said there will be enough space to put people in different buildings for the event, following COVID-19 safety guidelines. Doug said that Christian McCaffrey is expected to be one of the speakers in person, along with Beau Kitson (one of Zach`s best friends) and possibly Centennial football coach Richard Taylor. Ed McCaffrey is expected to attend, Doug said. Stanford`s Shaw is expected to express his thoughts on Hoffpauir in a video message, Doug said. Doug said that he could see his son`s world changing with the college coaching job. \"I figured out that`s his calling,\" Doug said. \"The first day he was on their campus, he was talking to a kid he brought into his office. He talked to him for two hours, telling him, `I believe in you.` Zach told me the story but never told me his name. He was from North Carolina. Had a lot in common.\" Hoffpauir`s death shook the football community throughout Arizona and beyond. Scottsdale Chaparral had battles against Hoffpauir and Centennial in 2010 state championship game and and the 2011 state semifinals. Chaparral won both meetings but Hoffpauir`s presence was felt by the Firebirds. \"I remember in the 2010, when he was a junior, and you could tell he was the leader of that team,\" said David Huffine, Chaparral`s offensive coordinator during that time. \"He was the guy they basically turned to. I remember a play on the right hash in the state championship game at Cardinals` stadium. We ran a trick play. A sweep to the left we ran a lot. We had Jordy Hein pulling up left-handed to throw to Jake Roh. We figured we never ran this play we could get them on it. Hoffpauir was playing the right hash. As soon as the ball is snapped, he beelines it to the goalline. I don`t know how he did it. He came out of nowhere and ran 60 yards and made an unbelievable play.\" Doug said that a Northern Colorado football player reached out to him the night after Zach`s death. \"It was neat to talk to that kid,\" Doug said. \"We spent an hour bawling. He said, `Your son was an angel.` \"In the midst of Zach trying to be normal (through the lockdown) and feel normal, he was reaching out to people. The sports side of it was great. But he reached into people.\" To suggest human-interest story ideas and other news, reach Obert at or 602-316-8827.
